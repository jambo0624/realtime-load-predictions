# Backend for Real-time Load Prediction

This directory will contain the server-side components and services for the real-time load prediction system.

## Planned Features

- RESTful API for model predictions and data access
- Data ingestion and processing pipelines
- Authentication and authorization services
- Model serving infrastructure
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Scheduled prediction jobs
- Data storage and management

## Technology Stack (Planned)

- FastAPI or Flask for API development
- SQLAlchemy for database ORM
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Redis for caching and messaging
- Celery for task queue and scheduled jobs
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration (optional)
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

## Structure (Future)

The backend will be organized using a service-oriented architecture:

```
backend/
├── api/                 # API endpoints and routes
├── services/            # Business logic and services
├── models/              # Data models and schemas
├── db/                  # Database connections and migrations
├── utils/               # Helper functions and utilities
├── tasks/               # Background and scheduled tasks
├── middleware/          # Request processing middleware
├── config/              # Configuration management
└── tests/               # Test suites
```

## Integration with ML Engine

The backend will integrate with the ML Engine by:

1. Loading trained models from the ML Engine's model repositories
2. Exposing prediction endpoints that use these models
3. Providing data access services for training and evaluation
4. Managing model versioning and deployment
5. Monitoring model performance in production

## Development (Future)

Instructions for setting up the development environment, running the services, and deploying to production will be provided here once development begins.
