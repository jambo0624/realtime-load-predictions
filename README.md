# Real-time Load Prediction

A comprehensive platform for predicting and managing compute resource usage in real-time.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into three main components:

- **ML Engine**: Machine learning models for predicting CPU and memory usage
- **Backend**: API services and data processing pipelines (future development)
- **Frontend**: User interface for visualizing predictions and metrics (future development)

## ML Engine

The ML Engine contains two versions of our prediction models:

- **Version 1 (v1)**: Basic implementation with limited features
- **Version 2 (v2)**: Advanced implementation with rich feature engineering

Each version includes preprocessing, training, and prediction components.

### Data Features

Detailed data field descriptions can be found in the ML Engine documentation.

## Future Development

### Backend Services (Planned)
- REST API for prediction services
- Data streaming and processing pipelines
- Authentication and authorization
- Monitoring and logging services

### Frontend (Planned)
- Interactive dashboards for resource usage visualization
- Prediction analysis and exploration tools
- User management interface
- Alert configuration for resource anomalies
